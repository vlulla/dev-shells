These are development shells using nix package manager.

To run them install Nix from [NixOS](https://nixos.org) and then in your shell
run the following:

```bash
$ nix-shell ./erlang-shell.nix
```

See the page [Declarative and reproducible developer 
environments](https://nix.dev/tutorials/declarative-and-reproducible-developer-environments.html)
for a more detailed explanation of creating a shell environment using Nix.
